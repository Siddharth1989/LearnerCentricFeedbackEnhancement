"Hi,Great job on submitting your first reflective diary for the semester.	Agency 3
This was a great reflection.	Agency 2
Just a suggestion to improve - Maybe also spend some time discussing the internal functioning of the group and your experience with it as you go. For example, you mentioned the possibility of a language barrier issue and the steps you would take as a team as time progresses. Was there any significant contribution from your end at the time that you thought would should be applied during the meeting and how did everyone react to that? Was there a previous experience to a similar situation that you may have faced and the steps you took personally to help overcome that challenge?	Impact 1
;Hope this helps." 85	Agency 3

"Hi;Xin,I can see you've put a lot of effort into this assignment.	Agency 2
It's very comprehensive and covers most of the important points.	Sensemaking 2
It was, however, a little difficult to folow at times.	Sensemaking 1
The points you make could have been more clearly expressed and succinct.	Sensemaking 1
;Your Executive Summary was a little unclear and hard to follow. For example the term ""SWOT"" is not defined nor explained.	Sensemaking 1
You cannot assume your audience already knows what it means. A good exec summary assumes the reader will not read further and therefore includes a succinct summary of the key points and recommendations.	Impact 1
Indeed, the term ""SWOT"" is mentioned throughout the report but at no time is it defined for the reader, even in the section ""SWOT Analysis"".	Sensemaking 1
Having said that, you do cover most of the important discussion points, and you do a quite good job of it.	Sensemaking 1
I think if you had presented the SWOT analysis in a regular paragraph format (and not in a table), with subheadings such as ""Strength, Weakness, Opportunity Threats"" then it would have made the report more easily readable.	Sensemaking 1
;Anyway, good effort!	Agency 2
All the best for your exam and future endeavours!	Agency 3
I really enjoyed teaching you.Peter H" 70	Agency 3

It doesn’t just coverwhat needs to be improved but also what the team has done well.	Sensemaking 1
In the lastbit, suggestion to improve with visual example is very good and helpful.	Sensemaking 1
What could be improved: Document/Assignment submission should be appropriately named so itis easy to find - including team number and the number for the team beingreviewing.	Impact 2
Description of ‘Audience’ is good but require clarity around someof the descriptions. Eg. ‘the page is too long which is good because mentors donot need to scroll down……’. This sentence is contradicting itself.	Sensemaking 1

The issues should be analysed in enough depth to enable the reader to understand / persuade the reader why the issue is important to the company and what the implications and risks would be for the business.	Impact 1

"A very good presentation covering the key aspects of negative and positive impacts.	Sensemaking 2
Excellent responses to the questions.	Sensemaking 2
Areas to improve are listed below.	Agency 1
No outline slide is an issue.	Sensemaking 1
Need to introduce thetopics to be discussed and who is going to discuss what.	Impact 1
Forthe stakeholders, it is important to also mention businesses, especially thatyou gave an example of 7-eleven implementation of facial recognition. Otherwise, your example is irrelevant.	Impact 1
;It isgreat that you had examples of facial recognition used in Australia and whatbenefits they can bring.	Sensemaking 1
I would separate the Australian government from lawenforcement. Unless you think they represent one entity, I would not list themas separate stakeholders.	Impact 1
;Needto give an introduction to the ethical design framework. Other students mightnot know what it is" 76	Impact 1

"Some useful suggestions, however, it's important that you also give detailed feedback - explain why the changes suggested would be beneficial / are needed in order to help the other team understand how to implement the feedback.	Impact 1
;Some general hints on giving constructive feedback:Be specific and give reasons – explain your feedback: To help the person understand why it should change	Impact 1
Don’t judge: Describe what could be done differently rather than state what is “good / bad / wrong / right”	Impact 1
Be helpful: Offer suggestions for improvement" 63	Impact 1

"A very good presentation where genuine issues were discussed and a clear conclusion is provided.	Sensemaking 2&Sensemaking 1
See my comments below.	Agency 1
I suggest giving a bit more details ofthe content in terms of who is going to talk about what.	Impact 1
The introduction was a bit too quick and content could be richer as the slide onlyhad “algorithm?”	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Needto set a context at the beginning and narrow down the topic so thatstakeholders are more specific.	Impact 1
However,it is good that you discussed the positive aspects and relate that to thestakeholders.	Sensemaking 1

"Agenda; Agenda and minutes submitted as a single document.	Sensemaking 1
A good agenda on a separate document should include the date, time, location, attendees and the chairperson for the meeting so there is no confusion.	Impact 1
To ensure your meeting is effective it is important the objective of the meeting is obvious. This could be included in the heading or as a separate section at the top of the meeting. For example: To seek feedback from our Industry mentor on what is working well and what needs to be done differently with our project but obviously it needs to be done in a separate document.	Impact 1

Template could have beenbetter.	Sensemaking 1
It's worth having a look at other templateoptions to see if this template is the best fit for the purpose of your minutes/ your content.	Impact 1

GENERAL O
HINTS: O
A couple of general hints for agendas and minutes:;Agenda:Why important: A good agenda ensures there is a clear objective for the meeting and that the discussion flows in a logical order to achieve that objective within the time allocated.What information should be included in the agenda:	Impact 1
;The basics: The first key part is the basics to ensure there is no confusion for attendees: Date, time, location, attendees and who is chairing the meeting.;	Impact 1
;The objective: The next critical part is the objective, this can be included in the title of the meeting and / or included in the top of the agenda if more details are needed.	Impact 1
;Discussion points: The next component is listing the points to be discussed. These can be done as statement or questions, for example, “Determining stakeholder needs” or “how do we understand our stakeholders needs?”. It is important that the points to be discussed are described in a way that is obvious to attendees of what is needing to be achieved. It is also important that they are listed in order of priority if unrelated or ordered in the most logical flow to achieve the objective of the meeting. This is particularly relevant where drawing out information or decisions are needed to make sense of the next point for discussion.	Impact 1
What other information should be included:Prework is assigned if relevant: The agenda should also set out any preparation required of the attendees so they come prepared and decisions can be made more thoroughly and efficiently.	Impact 1
Names are allocated to each discussion point: This will depend on the objective and type of meeting. Names should be allocated to a discussion point if there is an expectation that a particular attendee will facilitate or lead that section of the discussion.	Impact 1
;Broad times are allocated to each discussion point: Similarly, broad times should be allocated to each discussion point or section to help keep the discussion to time and ensure that all key discussion points are covered and the objective achieved.	Impact 1
; O
;Minutes:Why important: Minutes are an important written record of the key outcomes, decisions and actions made during a meeting so the team and anyone unable to attend has an accurate summary of what was agreed and everyone is clear on what actions need to be taken after the meeting.	Impact 1
;What information should be communicated in the minutes: The minutes should include:The basics: Who attended the meeting and who couldn’t make it (who was an apology), date, location, chair,Summary of the team’s decisions: Include the critical points and actions that lead to the decision or action item and any other important insights, risks or issues that might be significant to someone who could not attend.Summary of the actions: arising from the meeting including who is responsible for the action and when it needs to be completed.	Impact 1
How much to write:;Be as brief and concise as possible. Ask yourself, will point x matter in three weeks time?	Impact 1
Structure of minutes:;Choose a template that makes it easy for any member who was absent to understand what they need to know and do.	Impact 1
Use bullet points, bold or underline to highlight actions / who / deadline.	Impact 1
Compare various templates on the internet and choose the version that suits your team the best.	Agency 1&Impact 1
Ensure you have a clear logical meeting agenda for the minutes to be based on.	Impact 1

-In your attendee list, are all teammembers?	Impact 1

-Objective of the meeting could be clearer.	Impact 1
Yes, it is a problem statement presentation, but you could have thought aboutwhat exactly as a team you want to get out of the team or was there something youwanted to focus on and get IM’s feedback on.	Sensemaking 1
This would also help you framegood questions to ask. - Discussion points/feedback andaction items are very clearly capture, but action items should have estimateddeadlines. You could further improve by organising the discussion points as peragenda item.	Impact 1

Executive summary acted as a stand-alone document	Sensemaking 1
The purpose and objective of the report was clear	Sensemaking 1
Ways to improve:A number of key challenges/insights critical to the success of high performing teams could be there	Impact 1
Implications of Tuckman's stages of team development - eg. the Realisation that previously high performing / productive teams may revert back to forming or storming stages as a result of new team members and losing productivity.	Impact 1
New teams go through multiple stages before achieving high performance. If measures are not put in place there is a risk that teams may not evolve past conflict and remain dysfunctional (storming) etc etc.	Impact 1
Elaboration on why the Z Process is important to consider – ie. risk that the new teams no longer have the complementary workflow strengths/skills needed to complete their projects successfully (mix of creators, advancers, refiners and executors).	Impact 1

: To ensure your meeting is effective it is important the objective of the meeting is obvious. This could be included in the heading or as a separate section at the top of the meeting.

GENERAL HINTS:A couple of general hints for agendas and minutes:Agenda:Why important: A good agenda ensures there is a clear objective for the meeting and that the discussion flows in a logical order to achieve that objective within the time allocated.	Impact 1
What information should be included in the agenda:;The basics: The first key part is the basics to ensure there is no confusion for attendees: Date, time, location, attendees and who is chairing the meeting.	Impact 1
The objective: The next critical part is the objective, this can be included in the title of the meeting and / or included in the top of the agenda if more details are needed.	Impact 1
Discussion points: The next component is listing the points to be discussed. These can be done as statement or questions, for example, “Determining stakeholder needs” or “how do we understand our stakeholders needs?”. It is important that the points to be discussed are described in a way that is obvious to attendees of what is needing to be achieved. It is also important that they are listed in order of priority if unrelated or ordered in the most logical flow to achieve the objective of the meeting. This is particularly relevant where drawing out information or decisions are needed to make sense of the next point for discussion.	Impact 1
What other information should be included:Prework is assigned if relevant: The agenda should also set out any preparation required of the attendees so they come prepared and decisions can be made more thoroughly and efficiently.	Impact 1
Names are allocated to each discussion point: This will depend on the objective and type of meeting. Names should be allocated to a discussion point if there is an expectation that a particular attendee will facilitate or lead that section of the discussion.	Impact 1
;Broad times are allocated to each discussion point: Similarly, broad times should be allocated to each discussion point or section to help keep the discussion to time and ensure that all key discussion points are covered and the objective achieved.	Impact 1

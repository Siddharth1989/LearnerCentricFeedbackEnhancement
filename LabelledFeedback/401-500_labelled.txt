For example, the section on informed consent and psychological abuse had good insights and examples from the study.	Sensemaking 2&Sensemaking 1

Although, this is the main consideration of your assignment that need to be prioritized.

As per assignment guidelines, you were supposed to rank five papers that have cited the given paper.

Ensure that your codes are unique enough that they relate to only a single theme. If a code can be placed under more than a single theme, it means that the code is potentially too broad, or that there is too much crossover between themes and they are not sufficiently unique.For example, code 6 has the potential to be relevant to the first theme, as they both deal with obtaining information.	Impact 1
Although some codes have latent aspects, many of the codes included are focused on a semantic level of interpretation. It would be appropriate to include further latent codes, this means looking deeper into the substance of what is being said and the underlying meaning of what has been said, as opposed to a surface level interpretation.

There are however some aspects of your video/video treatment that need to be further refined to make it a thorough, critical, reflective and/or professional task.	Sensemaking 2
Firstly, there is lack of absolute live action content in your video and you heavily relied on static images in your video which is not based on the requirements of the task.	Sensemaking 1
You could also have made your content more interesting for the investors by showing how effectively this research can address the problems where the investors may want to invest (this is different to present a paper in a conference).

I appreciate your efforts on this task.	Agency 2
Some of the questions are responded nicely such as the impact.	Sensemaking 1
However, there are many aspects of your document that need to be further refined to make it a thorough, critical, reflective and/or professional report.	Sensemaking 2
You need to provide insight and justify each answer to make sure you fully address it. For example, for the conflict section, you need to find at least one prior art (and clearly mention the link to that prior art) which is related to this research (and there are as we carefully selected our papers) and mention the link to that prior art in your response.	Impact 1
Overall, your responses were mostly short (you could have used 50 words) and abstract and some do not have proper justification.	Sensemaking 2&Sensemaking 1

In this section of the assignment, I can see that some of the codes are describing latent issues, but most of them are semantic (surface level). One strategy for creating latent codes is to go through the transcripts several times and make sure that you have gone beyond the surface meaning of the data.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Try to use your own judgement and knowledge about the subject area of the interview to understand whether you can make more meaning out of the responses.	Impact 1

There are some areas for improvement in your assignment.	Sensemaking 2
Please make sure the codes should be consistent with the themes.	Impact 1
Good work in choosing key themes, as the key themes you have identified are distinct from other themes.	Sensemaking 1
The codes used within the main themes may be further improved. For example, they exhibit more semantic issues rather than latent issues, e.g. code 2, 8. latent codes or themes capture underlying ideas, patterns, and assumptions. This requires a more interpretative and conceptual orientation to the data.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
One suggestion to improve the codes is to revisit the data and become more familiar with some underlying ideas.	Impact 1
Some revision can also be used in your writing and language used within the codes to be more precise and clearer.	Impact 1
Some code descriptions are vague, which cannot support your codes, e.g. Code 1.	Sensemaking 1

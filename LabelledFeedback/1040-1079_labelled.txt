Task A For Routing rationale: Could also consider the threshold of data to be transmitted where 1Gbps begins to take less time than 100Mbps .	Impact 1
For Set up backward routes: Internet to R3: Internet does not need a default route to R3.	Sensemaking 1
For Subnet & Mask, range, leasetime, router, dns, domain name: DHCP range could use the local domain name server in delos.	Impact 1
Task C For DMZ to External: The servers in DMZ should only be allowed to initiate a communication if it is required by the service the server provides and only for that service.	Impact 1
For Internal to DMZ: Should use stateful inspection to determine who can intialise NEW traffic.	Impact 1

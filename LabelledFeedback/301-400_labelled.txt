Your business report covers many of discussion points and challenges relevant to the situation you were assigned to report on.	Sensemaking 2
However, many of those issues were glossed over and not explored enough in detail.	Sensemaking 1
For example, in your Challenges section you simply provided sub-headings and bullet points with know context provided or further discusion made to explain to your audience their relevance.	Sensemaking 1
The issues should be analysed in enough depth to enable the reader to understand / persuade the reader why the issue is important to the company and what the implications and risks would be for the business.

GENERAL O
HINTS: O
A couple of general hints for agendas and minutes:Agenda: Why important: A good agenda ensuresthere is a clear objective for the meeting and that the discussion flows in alogical order to achieve that objective within the time allocated.	Impact 1
What information should be included in theagenda: The basics: The first key part is thebasics to ensure there is no confusion for attendees: Date, time, location,attendees and who is chairing the meeting.	Impact 1
The objective: The next critical partis the objective, this can be included in the title of the meeting and / orincluded in the top of the agenda if more details are needed.	Impact 1
Discussion points: The next componentis listing the points to be discussed. These can be done as statement orquestions, for example, “Determining stakeholder needs” or “how do weunderstand our stakeholders needs?”. It is important that the points to bediscussed are described in a way that is obvious to attendees of what isneeding to be achieved. It is also important that they are listed in order ofpriority if unrelated or ordered in the most logical flow to achieve theobjective of the meeting. This is particularly relevant where drawing outinformation or decisions are needed to make sense of the next point fordiscussion.	Impact 1
What other information should be included: Preworkis assigned if relevant: The agenda should also set out anypreparation required of the attendees so they come prepared and decisions canbe made more thoroughly and efficiently.	Impact 1
Names are allocated to each discussionpoint: This will depend on the objective and type of meeting. Namesshould be allocated to a discussion point if there is an expectation that aparticular attendee will facilitate or lead that section of the discussion.	Impact 1
Broad times are allocated to each discussionpoint: Similarly, broad times should be allocated to each discussionpoint or section to help keep the discussion to time and ensure that all keydiscussion points are covered and the objective achieved.	Impact 1

"Feedback to Consider	Agency 1
Read like a business report – in first person (we) and focused on the problem, insights and actionable recommendations on how to address the problem (rather than focused on theory).	Sensemaking 2&Impact 1
Good structure to support your points including formatting and use of bullet points.	Sensemaking 1
The report was appropriately aimed at senior management.	Sensemaking 2
Check your English expression through a third party before submitting to ensure your message can be clearly understood.	Agency 1
The executive summary did not act completely as a stand alone document that could be read separately from the report.A good exec summary assumes the reader will not read further and therefore includes a succinct summary of the key points and recommendations.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Purpose and objective of the report was clear	Sensemaking 1
Some of the issues were glossed over. The issues should be analysed in enough depth to enable the reader to understand / persuade the reader why the issue is important to the company and what the implications and risks would be for the business. One way to address this is to include case studies or facts of why “issue x” could be a problem.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Considering the issues faced by virtual teams, multidisciplinary teams and cross cultural teams is a good way to start structuring your thinking.	Impact 3
Remember the audience and purpose of a business report.	Impact 3
This is not an essay. The focus should be on the practical application of the theory - not the theory itself. The report should be focused on the problem and practical solutions / insights to help the reader understand and address that problem. The reader should be able to walk away with practical and tangible recommendations they can implement.	Impact 2
Be careful not to overly summarise (gloss) over the recommendations. It should be clear to the reader why they are important and what specific actions the reader should take to implement them. For example, you could include examples or case studies for some of the broader recommendations so the reader knows how to implement.	Impact 1
Putting recommendations in a separate section help so that they don’t get “lost” in the report." 61	Impact 1

"Try and keep the executive summary less than a page but it might be a result of:The line spacing and font size was a bit much. Please usestandard formatting. This inflated the size of the reportsubstantially unnecessarily.	Impact 1&Sensemaking 1

"Feedback: O
Agenda: Objective of the meeting was not clear: To ensure your meeting is effective it is important the objective of the meeting is obvious. This could be included in the heading or as a separate section at the top of the meeting.

GENERAL O
HINTS: O
A couple of general hints for agendas and minutes:Agenda:Why important: A good agenda ensures there is a clear objective for the meeting and that the discussion flows in a logical order to achieve that objective within the time allocated.	Impact 1
What information should be included in the agenda:;The basics: The first key part is the basics to ensure there is no confusion for attendees: Date, time, location, attendees and who is chairing the meeting.	Impact 1
The objective: The next critical part is the objective, this can be included in the title of the meeting and / or included in the top of the agenda if more details are needed.	Impact 1
;Discussion points: The next component is listing the points to be discussed. These can be done as statement or questions, for example, “Determining stakeholder needs” or “how do we understand our stakeholders needs?”. It is important that the points to be discussed are described in a way that is obvious to attendees of what is needing to be achieved. It is also important that they are listed in order of priority if unrelated or ordered in the most logical flow to achieve the objective of the meeting. This is particularly relevant where drawing out information or decisions are needed to make sense of the next point for discussion.	Impact 1
What other information should be included:Prework is assigned if relevant: The agenda should also set out any preparation required of the attendees so they come prepared and decisions can be made more thoroughly and efficiently.	Impact 1
Names are allocated to each discussion point: This will depend on the objective and type of meeting. Names should be allocated to a discussion point if there is an expectation that a particular attendee will facilitate or lead that section of the discussion.	Impact 1
;Broad times are allocated to each discussion point: Similarly, broad times should be allocated to each discussion point or section to help keep the discussion to time and ensure that all key discussion points are covered and the objective achieved.	Impact 1
Minutes:Why important: Minutes are an important written record of the key outcomes, decisions and actions made during a meeting so the team and anyone unable to attend has an accurate summary of what was agreed and everyone is clear on what actions need to be taken after the meeting.	Impact 1
;What information should be communicated in the minutes: The minutes should include:The basics: Who attended the meeting and who couldn’t make it (who was an apology), date, location, chair,Summary of the team’s decisions: Include the critical points and actions that lead to the decision or action item and any other important insights, risks or issues that might be significant to someone who could not attend.Summary of the actions: arising from the meeting including who is responsible for the action and when it needs to be completed.	Impact 1
How much to write: Be as brief and concise as possible.	Impact 1
Ask yourself, will point x matter in three weeks time?	Impact 3
Structure of minutes: Choose a template that makes it easy for any member who was absent to understand what they need to know and do.	Impact 1
Use bullet points, bold or underline to highlight actions / who / deadline.	Impact 1
Compare various templates on the internet and choose the version that suits your team the best.	Agency 1

However, it is important to ensure that the agenda includes a clear objective especially when you have external people coming to the meeting.

For week 2, the student has identified three ethical issues from the given paper.	Sensemaking 1
Few improvements - it would have been better if ethical dimensions were defined first and then explained and justified by providing examples from the given paper.	Sensemaking 1
Also, there were many broken sentences.	Sensemaking 1
It would have been better if the report was proof read before submitting.	Sensemaking 2

For week 3, the student has selected five papers from the citation list and the content is based only on abstracts.	Sensemaking 1
A suggestion - you need to provide and justify the selection of papers based on the criteria of relevance of venue where the paper has been published, the publisher who has published the paper, who are the authors of the paper, are the author of paper renowned in their research area, what is the impact factor of the journal/conference, h-index of author and so on.	Sensemaking 1
Also, the justification of selecting papers could have been better instead of summarizing the abstract. 77.5	Sensemaking 1

There are some areas from improvement which incorporate: when you are suggesting new ethical dimensions such as Vulnerable participants, Informed consent, and invasion of privacy please make sure to provide further information on why it is important for researchers to follow ethical data practices and what makes these ethical dimensions significant in this case?	Impact 1
In terms of the quality of writing, please make sure to check your work for formal and academic writing.	Agency 1
Specifically, a few sentences can be further outlined to overall improve your discussion. E.g., within your sentence ""it is mentioned that before the experiment started, the researchers described the protocol to the children in words that they can understand."", this sentence should be further elaborated within your discussion.

It is good that you have identified five relevant papers. However, there are some recommendations to improve your argument about the relevance of these selected papers.	Sensemaking 1
First, you may provide more detailed examples to prove why the papers are relevant to the topic but not just simply summarize the abstract.	Impact 1
In addition, you could improve the argument by provide more explanations. For example, in the 2nd justification, you mentioned that ""this article ranked second because only five children with ASD interviewed, and the scale of the study was smaller than the first ranked article"". You should explain why you made a such conclusion.	Impact 1
Overall, you could use more room and more detailed examples to explain how and why you rank your papers like this. 77.5	Impact 1

There are a few ways through which you can improve your week 4 tasks further. First of all, in task 1, most of the problems that you identified were valid ones. Yet, some of the issues with questions were also not fully addressed.For example, Question 5 is still leading the participant positively, and if you plan to reuse the given three options, it's better to be rephrased.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
The second suggestion for Q7 is leading as well, and the scaling need to be replaced as this is a yes/no question.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Q9 is a sensitive question and could have been explained the annotations of the scale. (what does it mean by 1? and 10?)	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Q18 is irrelevant to the topic and could be removed from the survey.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
In task 2, all the questions you developed were open-ended. It is okay to add a few open-ended questions to a questionnaire, but we expect more closed-ended questions.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
Also, Q4 is a leading question, and the justifications could have been detailed. E.g. what would be the aims/importance of having such questions.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1

In this section of the assignment, you have identified more than six different open-ended prompts (different aspects) which are highly related to the selected topic, and they were in an appropriate order.	Sensemaking 1
Most questions are clear, and I could not find any major issues in them.	Sensemaking 1
However, some of the questions are closed, and there were no opportunities for the interviewee to expand. After going through the transcript, I felt that it's more like a Q&A session than an interview from the beginning. Thereby, even though you create an interview schedule, it is mostly used to guide the interview, and it does not necessarily mean that you have to stick to the order or the questions of the schedule 100%. So, when the participant responds, it is okay to ask questions around that (that are not initially in the interview schedule) and summarise their responses to see whether you have grasped the responses correctly.

There are several ways through which you can improve week 6 tasks.	Agency 1
First of all, with regard to creating latent codes, almost all the codes are semantic.	Sensemaking 1
The length of each code is questionable as we expect codes to be at least more than two words, make sure that they are not too long either.	Sensemaking 1
7/9 codes had only a single word, which couldnt be considered expressive.	Sensemaking 1
Also, the description of each code is poorly written, as we expect you to highlight the reason/importance of having this code.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
However, you have accurately listed three distinct themes, and they are relevant to the interview topic, broad enough to contain a set of codes.	Sensemaking 1
In terms of improvements, the justification could have been detailed by describing all the relevant codes/why this matters to the wider theme. 68.33	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1

Thanks for your response regarding the tasks.	Agency 3
For the first task, you have selected 4 clear questions from the interview and identified the issues they have accompanied with your suggestion how they can improve them. You did a good job on identifying the issues; however, your suggestions at times are unclear or ambiguous (such as item 3 which is still ambiguous, i.e., the term Perfect interaction).	Sensemaking 1
For the second task, you also did a good job; however, question 4 (i.e., item 4 in your list as you did not do a good numbering) is a bit unclear in terms of asking a how question but answering if they were different.	Sensemaking 1
Further, question 2 is implicit as you assume the student is not Australian.	Sensemaking 1
Also, you still can improve your justification to highlight more in-depth facts why those questions are beneficial and related to the main research topic.	Impact 1

You have prepared your interview schedule with a variety of different questions. Most questions are clear and I could not find any major issues in them.	Sensemaking 1
However, I recommend you to more generously use open-ended questions in your interview as you can see at times the participant have short answers which are lacking details.	Impact 1
Also, I recommend you to make a smaller number of questions as the participant have more space and time to go more deeply to the topics than sticking to some short and abstract answers to many different questions.	Impact 1
Lastly, the ordering of the question sin your schedule can have a more logical way.	Impact 1
For conducting the interview, you did a great job and everything went smoothly.	Sensemaking 1

I could not find any major issues there as you nicely made your code and categorised them under related themes, well-done!	Sensemaking 1&Agency 2
The only minor point was about your codes where some are still can be improved to be more specific and being more latent (please avoid having single word codes).	Impact 1
In terms of task 2, however, in the you needed to make sure that the description of the themes has a deeper justification to relate each theme to the wider theme.	Impact 1

It was great that you have found and organised five relevant papers.	Sensemaking 1
However, some further improvements are needed.	Sensemaking 2
In some cases, you did not quite clearly mention why you selected that particular paper. For example, justification for selecting paper 5 is very brief and general where you could have more highlight the particular issues related to that paper rather than just saying that both the papers discuss the 'uses the latest visualization technology to help children with autism'.

Similarly, you have not specifically discussed the reasons for your ranking from paper 1 to 5. You could have clearly mentioned how you have ranked those papers. This would help the reader to understand your justification for ranking.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1

The ideal length for each beat for a 90 seconds video should be between 10 to 15 seconds.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
In terms of the content, in the middle of the video, may be it could have been better if you discussed the exact technology you are using in this project more explicitly.	Sensemaking 1

The description provided is quite clear.	Sensemaking 1
Moreover, the linking between the dimension and evidence from the paper is also appropriate.	Sensemaking 1
However, the Privacy description is short as compared to the previous dimensions.	Sensemaking 1
In addition, you could minimize the text for defining each dimension and your opinion about it regardless of what the paper said. Then, a concluding sentence can further improve your discussion and exemplification.	Impact 1

The point of this task is missing in your submission.	Sensemaking 2
First, I could not find your first and fourth references as a work that cited the original paper we included in the assignment specifications.	Sensemaking 1
Secondly, some of the information which was included under justifications were not accurate. You need to select the papers based on two main factors the relevance of the paper (upon reading the abstract), which you did to some extent (for papers 2, 3 and 5), but the second factor the venue (e.g., the number of citations, H5 index, the ranking, the impact factors etc,.) have not been discussed.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
So how did you rank the papers from one to five? This was not clear to me.	Sensemaking 1

In each iteration, it sinks the largest unsorted item to the end of unsorted items and floats the smallest item to the start of unsorted items.For example, in the first iteration, the forward bubble sort will give us [1,4,2,5,0,2,8] and the reverse bubble sort will give us [0,1,4,2,5,2,8]. So after the first iteration, 0 will be in front and 8 will be in the last.In the second iteration, we only need to do bidirectional bubble sort within [1,4,2,5,2].

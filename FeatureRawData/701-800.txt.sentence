MODEL EVALUATION AND INFERENCE: &lt;br \&gt;Good evaluation with LSTM and CNN.	Sensemaking 1
More effort can be done for model inference, i.e. which features are important.	Impact 1
Since neural networks are black boxes, it would be challenging for you to do inference. However, there are gradient based methods which can show the importance level of the input.	Sensemaking 1

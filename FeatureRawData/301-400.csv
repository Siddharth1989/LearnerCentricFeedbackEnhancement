"Hi Zhou,Unfortunately, your Business Report was submitted 23 hours late so you have been marked down by 10% (56 - 5.6 = 50.4)Your business report covers many of discussion points and challenges relevant to the situation you were assigned to report on. However, many of those issues were glossed over and not explored enough in detail. For example, in your Challenges section you simply provided sub-headings and bullet points with know context provided or further discusion made to explain to your audience their relevance. The issues should be analysed in enough depth to enable the reader to understand / persuade the reader why the issue is important to the company and what the implications and risks would be for the business. One way to address this is to include case studies or facts of why “issue x” could be a problem.;All the best for your exam and future endeavours!I really enjoyed teaching you.Peter H.",50.4
"Overall good agenda and meeting minute.What could be improved:-No facilitator identified in agenda. Goodthat you have allocated time to each agenda item. -Objective of the meeting should be clearlystated. This is a very important part of your agenda. - While your minute template is agood one and easy to follow, I am not sure why your meeting minute contains ‘Strategiesfrom week 1’. Yes, you were supposed to apply the strategy but not include inyour actual meeting minute. It will not make sense if you need to circulatethis meeting minute to your IM.- I would have liked to see moreelaboration on the discussion points which would be most important part of theminute. - Good to be able to see yourreflection piece although you did not have to include it in your minute. Someof the points mentioned in your reflection piece actually belongs to yourmeeting discussion section. -Actionable items missing.",64.0
"The report covered the key requirement where key characteristics of a high-performing team are listed, followed by the challenges and recommendations. The challenges were discussed and clearly presented and the report is logically structured making it easy to follow and read. Ways to improve: The executive summary is very good as it summarized the key findings but it has to be specific listing all recommendations you proposed. I found the recommendations to be easier to follow if they are grouped or categorized based on the challengesI suggest discussing the key challenges in this scenario that are team development issues and virtual teams. Discuss how key challenges relevant to these two issues and what would you recommend in relation to them.    ",73.5

The basics structure of an agenda was missing: The agenda is not clearly a separate document in this case.The objective of the meeting was not clear: To ensure your meeting is effective it is important the objective of the meeting is obvious. This could be included in the heading or as a separate section at the top of the meeting. For example: To seek feedback from our Industry mentor on what is working well and what needs to be done differently with our projectDiscussion points were not explained: If this agenda is shared with stakeholders they wouldn't know what you mean by open data and news. Possibly 1-2 lines description helps the audience of the meeting to understand why it is important to discuss that point. Template for Minutes did not suit purpose or content: It's worth having a look at other template options to see if this template is the best fit for the purpose of your minutes / your content. Team members or other stakeholders who could not attend the meeting need to understand from the minutes. Your outcomes and action plans were well written. ,55.0

"Very good set of minutes, however the agenda was; very brief and would struggle as a stand alone document.Some suggestions for the agenda, it was good to see a chairperson nominated to avoid any confusion of who would take the lead. However, it is important to ensure that the agenda includes a clear objective especially when you have external people coming to the meeting.

"Feedback for Week 2:For week 2, the student has identified three ethical issues from the given paper. Few improvements - it would have been better if ethical dimensions were defined first and then explained and justified by providing examples from the given paper. Also, there were many broken sentences. It would have been better if the report was proof read before submitting.Feedback for Week 3:For week 3, the student has selected five papers from the citation list and the content is based only on abstracts. A suggestion - you need to provide and justify the selection of papers based on the criteria of relevance of venue where the paper has been published, the publisher who has published the paper, who are the authors of the paper, are the author of paper renowned in their research area, what is the impact factor of the journal/conference, h-index of author and so on. Also, the justification of selecting papers could have been better instead of summarizing the abstract. You received 14.5 marks for Week 1 and 16.9 marks for Week 3.",77.5
"Feedback for Week 2:There are some areas from improvement which incorporate: when you are suggesting new ethical dimensions such as Vulnerable participants, Informed consent, and invasion of privacy please make sure to provide further information on why it is important for researchers to follow ethical data practices and what makes these ethical dimensions significant in this case? In terms of the quality of writing, please make sure to check your work for formal and academic writing. Specifically, a few sentences can be further outlined to overall improve your discussion. E.g., within your sentence ""it is mentioned that before the experiment started, the researchers described the protocol to the children in words that they can understand."", this sentence should be further elaborated within your discussion. Feedback for Week 3:It is good that you have identified five relevant papers. However, there are some recommendations to improve  your argument about the relevance of these selected papers. First, you may provide more detailed examples to prove why the papers are relevant to the topic but not just simply summarize the abstract. In addition, you could improve the argument by provide more explanations. For example, in the 2nd justification, you mentioned that ""this article ranked second because only five children with ASD interviewed, and the scale of the study was smaller than the first ranked article"". You should explain why you made a such conclusion. Overall,  you could use more room and more detailed examples to explain how and why you rank your papers like this.You received 16.1 marks for Week 1 and 15.2 marks for Week 3.",77.5
"Feedback for Week 4:There are a few ways through which you can improve your week 4 tasks further. First of all, in task 1, most of the problems that you identified were valid ones. Yet, some of the issues with questions were also not fully addressed. For example, Question 5 is still leading the participant positively, and if you plan to reuse the given three options, it's better to be rephrased. The second suggestion for Q7 is leading as well, and the scaling need to be replaced as this is a yes/no question. Q9 is a sensitive question and could have been explained the annotations of the scale. (what does it mean by 1? and 10?) Q18 is irrelevant to the topic and could be removed from the survey.  In task 2, all the questions you developed were open-ended. It is okay to add a few open-ended questions to a questionnaire, but we expect more closed-ended questions. Also, Q4 is a leading question, and the justifications could have been detailed. E.g. what would be the aims/importance of having such questions.Feedback for Week 5:In this section of the assignment, you have identified more than six different open-ended prompts (different aspects) which are highly related to the selected topic, and they were in an appropriate order. Most questions are clear, and I could not find any major issues in them. However, some of the questions are closed, and there were no opportunities for the interviewee to expand. After going through the transcript, I felt that it's more like a Q&A session than an interview from the beginning. Thereby, even though you create an interview schedule, it is mostly used to guide the interview, and it does not necessarily mean that you have to stick to the order or the questions of the schedule 100%. So, when the participant responds, it is okay to ask questions around that (that are not initially in the interview schedule) and summarise their responses to see whether you have grasped the responses correctly. Feedback for Week 6:There are several ways through which you can improve week 6 tasks. First of all, with regard to creating latent codes, almost all the codes are semantic.  The length of each code is questionable as we expect codes to be at least more than two words, make sure that they are not too long either. 7/9 codes had only a single word, which couldnt be considered expressive. Also, the description of each code is poorly written, as we expect you to highlight the reason/importance of having this code. However, you have accurately listed three distinct themes, and they are relevant to the interview topic, broad enough to contain a set of codes. In terms of improvements, the justification could have been detailed by describing all the relevant codes/why this matters to the wider theme.You received 16 marks for Week 4, 9 marks for Week 5 and 15 marks for Week 6",68.33
"Feedback for Week 4:Thanks for your response regarding the tasks. For the first task, you have selected 4 clear questions from the interview and identified the issues they have accompanied with your suggestion how they can improve them. You did a good job on identifying the issues; however, your suggestions at times are unclear or ambiguous (such as item 3 which is still ambiguous, i.e., the term Perfect interaction). For the second task, you also did a good job; however, question 4 (i.e., item 4 in your list as you did not do a good numbering) is a bit unclear in terms of asking a how question but answering if they were different. Further, question 2 is implicit as you assume the student is not Australian. Also, you still can improve your justification to highlight more in-depth facts why those questions are beneficial and related to the main research topic. Feedback for Week 5:You have prepared your interview schedule with a variety of different questions. Most questions are clear and I could not find any major issues in them. However, I recommend you to more generously use open-ended questions in your interview as you can see at times the participant have short answers which are lacking details. Also, I recommend you to make a smaller number of questions as the participant have more space and time to go more deeply to the topics than sticking to some short and abstract answers to many different questions. Lastly, the ordering of the question sin your schedule can have a more logical way. For conducting the interview, you did a great job and everything went smoothly. Overall, good job!Feedback for Week 6:Overall, you did a good job in task 1. I could not find any major issues there as you nicely made your code and categorised them under related themes, well-done! The only minor point was about your codes where some are still can be improved to be more specific and being more latent (please avoid having single word codes). In terms of task 2, however, in the you needed to make sure that the description of the themes has a deeper justification to relate each theme to the wider theme. Anyway, I do not see any major issues here and I hope you can keep it up for the next assignment. Good job!You received 16 marks for Week 4, 13 marks for Week 5 and 18 marks for Week 6",78.33
"Feedback for Week 2:You have rightly identified three relevant ethical issues. However, there are some areas that need improvements. You have structured your writing quite well and tried to start your discussion by introducing the key ethical issues. You could present a more organised and improved introduction by citing relevant work.   In terms of the quality of writing, please make sure to check your work for formal and academic writing, try to avoid unclear and complex sentences. This can help to improve your discussion.Feedback for Week 3:It was great that you have found and organised five relevant papers. However, some further improvements are needed. In some cases, you did not quite clearly mention why you selected that particular paper. For example, justification for selecting paper 5 is very brief and general where you could have more highlight the particular issues related to that paper rather than just saying that both the papers discuss the 'uses the latest visualization technology to help children with autism'. Similarly, you have not specifically discussed the reasons for your ranking from paper 1 to 5. You could have clearly mentioned how you have ranked those papers. This would help the reader to understand your justification for ranking. You received 14.8 marks for Week 1 and 16.4 marks for Week 3.",77.5
"Feedback for Week 10 + 11:There are several ways to improve your work further. In terms of the treatment plan, it is important that all beats are approximately of the same length. However, some of your beats were either too short or too long (for example, the last two beats were really short). The ideal length for each beat for a 90 seconds video should be between 10 to 15 seconds. In terms of the content, in the middle of the video, may be it could have been better if you discussed the exact technology you are using in this project more explicitly. You also need to attribute the content you take from other sources (this could be done either in the video itself or in the treatment plan). Feedback for Week 12:There are several ways to improve your week 12 assignment tasks. For some of the questions, your answers were a bit narrow in focus and such answers could be improved further by making them more specific. For example, your answers for the question on technology could consist information about the exact technology or the framework used in this research project. Your decision regarding patenting was good. However, it was not backed up by your answer about the prior arts. Even though you might have not found the exact idea in prior arts, similar ideas can still be counted for this. You received 34 marks for Week 10 and 11 and 7 marks for Week 12",68.33
"Feedback for Week 2:You have successfully identified three ethical issues, and you did explain them in detail. The description provided is quite clear. Moreover, the linking between the dimension and evidence from the paper is also appropriate. However, the  Privacy description is short as compared to the previous dimensions. In addition, you could minimize the text for defining each dimension and your opinion about it regardless of what the paper said. Then, a concluding sentence can further improve your discussion and exemplification. The quality of the writing in terms of grammar and spelling is above the expected level, but adding some references would further improve your work.  Feedback for Week 3:The point of this task is missing in your submission. First, I could not find your first and fourth references as a work that cited the original paper we included in the assignment specifications. Secondly, some of the information which was included under justifications were not accurate. You need to select the papers based on two main factors the relevance of the paper (upon reading the abstract), which you did to some extent (for papers 2, 3 and 5), but the second factor the venue (e.g., the number of citations, H5 index, the ranking, the impact factors etc,.) have not been discussed. So how did you rank the papers from one to five? This was not clear to me. Also, the justification of relevance based on the abstract is very short and very hard to judge the ranking based on those short sentences. You received 19.4 marks for Week 1 and 11.5 marks for Week 3.",77.5
"Feedback for Week 10 + 11:Overall, good video. You have used both live videos and the contents from online which was good. However, there are some issues that you can consider. In your first beat, you could slow down the transitions between different clips. You added justification in the last column for your script as well as your audio but in most of the cases, you did not adequately discuss why have you added that script and how it is contributing to the whole argument that you are making.  From your video, it was clear that you have used content from other sources, but no attributions are given (either in video or treatment).Feedback for Week 12:Well done! You have well presented the summary, problem being tackled, potential solutions, and the technology being used. However, there are some areas of improvement. You did not explicitly mention yes/no regarding the patenting option, you only talked about the usefulness of the technology. It would have been better if you could directly relate this usefulness with novelty and present your thoughts about patenting. You could relate your patenting discussion with the prior art as well. You also did not present any reasoning about the commercial potential. You received 34 marks for Week 10 and 11 and 7 marks for Week 12",68.33
"Feedback for Week 2:You mentioned ""Right of withdrawal is a concept where research participants have a right to exit the research study whenever they want to."" To improve this work, you could relate the issues to the ethical relevant dimensions with a brief explanation of what these dimensions are. you could write another sentence to give a brief explanation of what this dimension is; Thus, this can help readers to understand the reasons why the ethical issue you mentioned belongs to such dimension and reinforces the relationship between them. Feedback for Week 3:You mentioned "" The authors have worked profusely in the field of human-computer interaction and it’s various applications in the domain of child care."" You could make your argument more reasonable and clearer by expressing the idea of the papers in your own words instead of repeating the content of the abstract, which is hard to understand for people who are not the experts in such discipline.You received 15.8 marks for Week 1 and 15.1 marks for Week 3.",77.5

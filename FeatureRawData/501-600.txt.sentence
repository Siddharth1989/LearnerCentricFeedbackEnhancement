It is good that you have identified five relevant papers. However, there are some recommendations to improve your argument about the relevance of these selected papers. First, you may provide more detailed examples to prove why the papers are relevant to the topic but not just simply summarize the abstract. In addition, you could improve the argument by provide more explanations. For example, in the 1st justification, you mentioned that ""This paper is highly related to the topic we are going to explore"". You should explain why you made a such conclusion. Overall, you could use more room and more detailed examples to explain how and why you rank your papers like this.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1

Task-1. First, we don't think there exist any issues with Ques:14 as you did. Then, the improvements suggested are inappropriate. More specifically, your improvement for Ques:14 incorporates ""We can reduce the scope of this question by asking a more specific question. E.g., What should be improved during the on-boarding process."", isn't it leading which assumes something need to be improved? It would be best if you improved questions in such a way that it shouldn't create any confusion among the participants and are not biased or leading.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
For week-4 task 2, you prepared both open and close-ended questions. Most questions are not relatively straightforward and can be improved in wording and rephrasing.

For week 12, the summary does not cover all aspects of the work you selected. A summary should clearly describe what the work is.	Sensemaking 1
Abstract is normally the summary written by the authors and the summary of this impact declaration should be a summary of the abstract without using too many terms and jargon.	Sensemaking 1
Although you have mentioned the problem, but it is quite general and not clearly articulated with details. You need to define this problem firstly and then discuss further with explanations why the problem is a significant research problem that needs to be tackled.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1
One-sentence answer could be further explained.	Sensemaking 1

You mentioned “Lastly, physical or psychological harm or abuse is also an important ethical issue.” physical or psychological harm or abuse is an ethical dimension, not an ethical issue.	Sensemaking 1
Didn’t distinguish issues from dimensions It’s hard to tell which one is the issue and which one is the dimension.	Sensemaking 1
Ethical Issues are specific ethical issues related to specific research projects and dimensions are the ethical standards that researchers should follow in order to avoid potential ethical issues and protect research participants.	Sensemaking 1
To improve your work, each ethical issue should be discussed at the beginning of each paragraph and then you could state which dimensions is associated with, so that readers could tell which one is an issue and which one is the associated dimension.	Impact 1
Also, please use the words “dimension” and “issues” explicitly when describing them so that readers won’t be confused.	Impact 1

A total of four questions were identified in task 1.	Sensemaking 1
Issues identified for each question were highlighted and some suggestions to improve the questions were made.	Sensemaking 1
Issues identified were clear and but not well-described.	Sensemaking 1
My suggestion is that for the suggested improvements, it would be good if you can provide a reworded question to replace each of the problematic questions you identified. For example, you could further work on Q11 and Q13.	Impact 1
Task 2, there is nothing wrong with the questions and its logical order. However, Q5 is a leading question. Thereby, instead of asking how dissatisfied are you with the approaches you could have asked what would you suggest to improve the University's current onboarding process.	Sensemaking 1&Impact 1

For this section of the assignment, you have identified six different open-ended prompts (different aspects) which are highly related to the selected topic, and they were in an appropriate order.	Sensemaking 1

t is good that all your main questions, followup/probing questions do not include any problematic factors, and they are not sensitive or complex. However, there were some questions and cannot be considered as open questions which may lead to very short responses from the participants as you can see from your transcript. For example, if you closely look at your first half of the interview, almost all of the follow-up question were closed-ended and you've got only short answers and you couldnt dig deeper in to it.	Sensemaking 1
Also, it is better to summarise the responses of the interviewee at times to confirm what you heard when they make a point/argument on a given factor.	Impact 1

The aim of conducting these interviews were to identify hidden insights of the university onboarding process and challenges in it. However, I dont see how the introductory code would fit in here, as we couldnt get any information from this code in term of the research.	Sensemaking 1
Also, most of the codes you created for task 2 were semantic codes, not latent ones.	Sensemaking 1
One strategy for creating latent codes is to go through the transcripts several times and make sure that you have gone beyond the surface meaning of the data.	Sensemaking 1
In addition, the code description is not detailed enough to depict the importance of this code.	Sensemaking 1
Furthermore, we expect you to include a high level justification for each theme. However, you failed to describe how the selected codes are relevant to your theme by taking for about 150 words each.	Sensemaking 1

Thanks for your response to this task, the box plot and the iqr value are correct; however, all other values are incorrect. E.g., the values of standard deviations for population and sample ones are incorrect.	Sensemaking 1
Also, we expected a better annotation in your matlab script (fully commented code) though you were allowed to use built-in functions in matlab to calculate the required parameters for the first three parts.	Sensemaking 1

You described the hypothesis well, but it is was nice to have it more specific and when defining your null mentioning the statistically difference term.	Sensemaking 1
Further, you had a good explanation on the types of data needed to be collected but less attention to the budget and the feasibility and the relation of them to testing the hypothesis in the collection process.	Sensemaking 1
The other issue with your task was about a lack of in-depth justification on your reasons of choosing the test for your statistical analysis.	Sensemaking 1
You could have briefly compared it to the other tests we learned in this unit (you could have referred to the data type like parametric vs non-parametric data).	Sensemaking 1
There was a chart in the pre-workshop materials showing how we can select the best test based on the data type.	Sensemaking 1
Lastly the limitation and future investigation can be further developed as they are lacking in-depth insights about many other aspects of the research.	Sensemaking 1

You did a good job in calculating the accuracy based on a correct confusion matrix; however, you missed the requirement of the task which asked you to that all working out (including the steps) should be done by hand (i.e., hand written or shown in full in a word or excel document) for the confusion matrix.

Argument for the performance of accuracy metric is also lacking proper insights where you could have discussed the sampling limitations, etc.	Sensemaking 1

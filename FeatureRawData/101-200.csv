"Hi,Great job on submitting your first reflective diary for the semester.This was a great reflection. Just a suggestion to improve - Maybe also spend some time discussing the internal functioning of the group and your experience with it as you go. For example, you mentioned the possibility of a language barrier issue and the steps you would take as a team as time progresses. Was there any significant contribution from your end at the time that you thought would should be applied during the meeting and how did everyone react to that? Was there a previous experience to a similar situation that you may have faced and the steps you took personally to help overcome that challenge?;Hope this helps.",85.0

"Hi;Xin,I can see you've put a lot of effort into this assignment. It's very comprehensive and covers most of the important points. It was, however, a little difficult to folow at times. The points you make could have been more clearly expressed and succinct.;Your Executive Summary was a little unclear and hard to follow. For example the term ""SWOT"" is not defined nor explained. You cannot assume your audience already knows what it means. A good exec summary assumes the reader will not read further and therefore includes a succinct summary of the key points and recommendations. Indeed, the term ""SWOT"" is mentioned throughout the report but at no time is it defined for the reader, even in the section ""SWOT Analysis"". Having said that, you do cover most of the important discussion points, and you do a quite good job of it. I think if you had presented the SWOT analysis in a regular paragraph format (and not in a table), with subheadings such as ""Strength, Weakness, Opportunity Threats"" then it would have made the report more easily readable.;Anyway, good effort!All the best for your exam and future endeavours!I really enjoyed teaching you.Peter H",70.0

"The feedback is constructive and useful. It doesn’t just coverwhat needs to be improved but also what the team has done well. In the lastbit, suggestion to improve with visual example is very good and helpful.What could be improved:·      Document/Assignment submission should be appropriately named so itis easy to find - including team number and the number for the team beingreviewing.·      Description of ‘Audience’ is good but require clarity around someof the descriptions. Eg. ‘the page is too long which is good because mentors donot need to scroll down……’. This sentence is contradicting itself.·      Instead of saying ‘there existproblems or another problem is about….’, you could say ‘while ??? is good itcould be further improved by …‘ This way, you avoid judgement.",70.0

"Feedback to ConsiderRead like a business report – in first person (we) and focused on the problem, insights and actionable recommendations on how to address the problem (rather than focused on theory). Good structure to support your points including formatting and use of bullet points.The report was appropriately aimed at senior management.English expression was appropriate.Executive summary acted as a stand alone documentPurpose and objective of the report was clearSome of the issues were glossed over. The issues should be analysed in enough depth to enable the reader to understand / persuade the reader why the issue is important to the company and what the implications and risks would be for the business. One way to address this is to include case studies or facts of why “issue x” could be a problem. Considering the issues faced by virtual teams, multidisciplinary teams and cross cultural teams is a good way to start structuring your thinking. Challenges were explained so the reader could understand what the implications / problems would be for the organisationRecommendations were succinct, useful and delivered in a way that the reader could readily implement.",63.0
"A very good presentation covering the key aspects of negative and positive impacts. Excellent responses to the questions. Areas to improve are listed below.No outline slide is an issue. Need to introduce thetopics to be discussed and who is going to discuss what.Forthe stakeholders, it is important to also mention businesses, especially thatyou gave an example of 7-eleven implementation of facial recognition. Otherwise, your example is irrelevant.;It isgreat that you had examples of facial recognition used in Australia and whatbenefits they can bring. I would separate the Australian government from lawenforcement. Unless you think they represent one entity, I would not list themas separate stakeholders.;Needto give an introduction to the ethical design framework. Other students mightnot know what it is",76.0

"A very good presentation where genuine issues were discussed and a clear conclusion is provided. See my comments below.I suggest giving a bit more details ofthe content in terms of who is going to talk about what.The introduction was a bit too quick and content could be richer as the slide onlyhad “algorithm?”Needto set a context at the beginning and narrow down the topic so thatstakeholders are more specific.  However,it is good that you discussed the positive aspects and relate that to thestakeholders. A very good examples when discussing the negative aspects.However, some issues need to be explained such as political polarization. Somegood examples were mentioned but I would like them to be listed in slides andexplained especially when it comes to reporting surveys and facts.",68.4

"Agenda; Agenda and minutes submitted as a single     document. A good agenda on a separate document should include the date,     time, location, attendees and the chairperson for the meeting so there is     no confusion. To ensure your meeting is effective it is     important the objective of the meeting is obvious. This could be included     in the heading or as a separate section at the top of the meeting. For     example: To seek feedback from our Industry mentor on what is working well     and what needs to be done differently with our project but obviously it     needs to be done in a separate document.;Minutes:;·;;;;;;;The key basics of the minutes are goodTemplate could have beenbetter.

These can be done as statement or questions, for example, “Determining stakeholder needs” or “how do we understand our stakeholders needs?”. It is important that the points to be discussed are described in a way that is obvious to attendees of what is needing to be achieved. It is also important that they are listed in order of priority if unrelated or ordered in the most logical flow to achieve the objective of the meeting. This is particularly relevant where drawing out information or decisions are needed to make sense of the next point for discussion.What other information should be included:Prework is assigned if relevant: The agenda should also set out any preparation required of the attendees so they come prepared and decisions can be made more thoroughly and efficiently.Names are allocated to each discussion point: This will depend on the objective and type of meeting. Names should be allocated to a discussion point if there is an expectation that a particular attendee will facilitate or lead that section of the discussion.;Broad times are allocated to each discussion point: Similarly, broad times should be allocated to each discussion point or section to help keep the discussion to time and ensure that all key discussion points are covered and the objective achieved.;;Minutes:Why important: Minutes are an important written record of the key outcomes, decisions and actions made during a meeting so the team and anyone unable to attend has an accurate summary of what was agreed and everyone is clear on what actions need to be taken after the meeting.;What information should be communicated in the minutes: The minutes should include:The basics: Who attended the meeting and who couldn’t make it (who was an apology), date, location, chair,Summary of the team’s decisions: Include the critical points and actions that lead to the decision or action item and any other important insights, risks or issues that might be significant to someone who could not attend.Summary of the actions: arising from the meeting including who is responsible for the action and when it needs to be completed.How much to write:;Be as brief and concise as possible. Ask yourself, will point x matter in three weeks time?Structure of minutes:;Choose a template that makes it easy for any member who was absent to understand what they need to know and do. Use bullet points, bold or underline to highlight actions / who / deadline. Compare various templates on the internet and choose the version that suits your team the best.

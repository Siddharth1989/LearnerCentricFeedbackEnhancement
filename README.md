# LearnerCentricFeedbackEnhancement
Developing a feedback theory-informed natural language processing (NLP) model to enable large-scale evaluation of written feedback, and analysing a large set of feedback extracted from Moodle using this model to understand the presence of learner-centred feedback elements, the commonality and differences in feedback provision across disciplines.
This code includes the primary and secondary implementations for RQ1, RQ2, RQ3 and RQ4. The code for RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 is in a single file. The code for RQ4 is split across multiple files, Parts 1,2-5. The files are in .ipynb format.

    "## Feedback Preprocessing - Stage 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**BACKGROUND**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing of the feedback data was done through the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stage 0: The initial raw data files containing the feedback were sourced from Monash University's Master of Data Science course. The required data was isolated and filtered out from the original data. Additionally, the feedback text contained a lot of dirty characters including HTML code. Through a meticulous data wrangling process, these the feeback text was cleaned and brought into a final form which was to be labelled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback data was labelled with the help of a lightweight text annotation tool called Yedda. Yedda was customised to include the below 8 rubrics of Learner-centred feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus on Future Impact**:\n",
    "   - Impact 1: Provide actionable information for improving on specific aspects of the student's task\n",
    "   - Impact 2: Provide actionable information for improving the overall task, in line with the learning outcomes.\n",
    "   - Impact 3: Provide actionable information for the student to improve certain skills and strategies beyond the scope of the learning outcomes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Sensemaking**:\n",
    "  - Sensemaking 1: Higlight strengths and weaknesses of specific aspects of the student's work.\n",
    "  - Sensemkaing 2: Highlight the overall strengths and weaknesses of the student's work with respect to the learning outcomes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Support Agency**:\n",
    "  - Agency 1: Encourage the student to look up the academic material or feedback, look up sources on the internet for more information or reach out to the teacher regarding the feedback or learning outcomes.\n",
    "  - Agency 2: Provide statements that affirm and acknowledge the student's work.\n",
    "  - Agency 3: Include comments that help foster a closer teacher-student relationship.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Yedda tool exports the labelled data as `.sentence` files. For more information on the usage of this tool, please click here: [Yedda](https://github.com/jiesutd/YEDDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will load the `.sentence` files that have been generated from the annotation process. For better manoeuvrability, we can use the Pandas library to load these files into dataframes and then combine them into a single dataframe with 1000 annotated text samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yedda exported `.sentence` files were converted into standard text files before loading them here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The code for Preprocessing stage 0 could not be shared in this repository due to confidentially reasons. FOr any queries regarding the preprocessing steps, please reach out to me on my email ID: siddharthgupte@hotmail.com\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of the steps in this notebook, the stage 1 file was converted to a stage 2 file in excel by adding a new column called `FeedbackCode`. To view this column, please refer to the `stage2.csv` file in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us load the required libraries including `Pandas` and `itertools`."
